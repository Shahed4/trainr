# General Coding Conventions

## Naming
- Use **descriptive variable and function names** that clearly convey purpose.
- Avoid single-letter or ambiguous names.
  - Good: `matchedUsersList`, `isMatchRequestPending`, `fetchTrainingSession`
  - Bad: `data`, `flag`, `x`

## Comments & Docstrings
- Add comments explaining **why** something is done, not just what.
- Focus on intent, edge cases, and non-obvious logic.
- Every function (frontend and backend) must have a **brief comment or docstring** summarizing its purpose, parameters, and return value.

## Placeholder / Incomplete Features
- Whenever an incomplete or placeholder feature is added, leave a comment starting with `MUST CHANGE LATER` explaining what needs to be finished.

```
// MUST CHANGE LATER: Replace hardcoded URL with environment variable
```

```python
# MUST CHANGE LATER: Add proper error handling for rate limiting
```
