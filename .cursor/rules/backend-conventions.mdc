# Backend Conventions

## Django REST Framework Views
- All API views must be **function-based views** using DRF's `@api_view` decorator.
- Every view function **must** include a docstring describing what it does, expected parameters, and response shape.

## Python Package Management
- Use **uv** for all Python package management. Never use bare `pip`.
  - Install: `uv pip install <package>`
  - Run scripts: `uv run <script>`
  - Add dependency: `uv add <package>`
- Keep `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth for dependencies.

## View Naming
- Use clear, verb-prefixed names for views that describe the action: `get_`, `create_`, `update_`, `delete_`, `list_`.
- The frontend API wrapper in `lib/api.ts` should mirror the view name in camelCase.
